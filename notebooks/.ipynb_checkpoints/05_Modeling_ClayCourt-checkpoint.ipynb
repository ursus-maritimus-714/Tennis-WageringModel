    "## Introduction to Modeling (Clay Court Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous stage (see Workbook 4; Preprocessing_Training_Clay), two simple benchmark models were generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Dummy\" Model, where the mean % total points won for given player in the training split (75% of hard court data from 2012-2019) was used to predict % total points won by a given player in a given match: \n",
    "    * Mean error (RMSE): 6.65% Train; 6.54% Test\n",
    "* Multivariate linear model including only ATP rankings (raw and matchup-differential) information in the same training split: \n",
    "    * Mean error/Standard Deviation (RMSE): 6.55% (.07%) Train; 6.42% Test\n",
    "* Here, the entire set of raw and differential predictive features (~150) is used to predict the target of % total points won by a given player in a given match. This is the clay court version; hard court prediction is conducted in a separate workbook (05_ModelingHardCourt).\n",
    "* Because Clay Court matches constitute only ~30% of the total sample, for the Clay Court model (see notebook 05_Modeling_Claycourt) an additional 3 years were used for modeling (2012-2019), with 2009-2011 additionally used for past performance match stats accrual for predictive feature generation. \n",
    "     * For the Hard Court model, data from years 2015-2019 are used in modeling, with an additional 3 years prior to that (2012-2014) used for past performance match stats accrual for predictive feature generation.\n",
    "    * These ranges were systematically determined to be optimal for the available data in the original Tennis Pediction Project (see Reporting folder for that project for data, figures and analysis)\n",
    "* A threshold of minimum of 20 prior matches for BOTH players in a given match to be predicted on is employed in the modeling stage. Not surprisingly, prediction accuracy is sensitive to the amount of data available to generate predictive features, as well as to the amount of data available to train and test the model. Critically, matches filtered out in the present stage WERE used in previous stages for stats accrual/feature development (though those matches filtered out in the initial stage WERE NOT used in feature accrual; see below)\n",
    "    * As a reminder, in the initial stage (see Workbook 1) of the project, matches played on grass (too low a sample size; also removed Davis up and Olympics matches for same reason as well as for their \"odd\" contexts) and matches where one player withdrew (usually for injury reason) either before the match or early on in the match were filtered out and NOT included in feature generation. \n",
    "* Gradient Boosting Regression model was determined to yield the best prediction for this dataset in the original Tennis Prediction Project and is also used presently, with the hyperparameters determined to be optimal in the original project.\n",
    "* Finally, and the critical new addition in this iteration, the full best model is run both with and without the implied probabilities (with vig removed!) derived from Dan Westin's historical wagering odds archive (http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php) \n"
